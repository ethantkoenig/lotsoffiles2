## Definition

In modern English, to hope is to desire that something for the future without complete certainty that it will happen. By contrast, hope is only used in the Bible to refer to a sure expectation that something will happen.

* The ultimate hope is being assured of our salvation through our faith in Christ. Peter calls this our "living hope."
