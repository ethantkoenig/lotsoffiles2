# I, Yahweh; me, Yahweh

## Definition

Many times in the Old Testament, when God is speaking about himself, he uses his name instead of a pronoun.

* For example, instead of saying, "Honor me," he says, "Honor Yahweh." 
* To make it clear that God is the one talking about himself, the ULB often translates this by adding a pronoun such as in, "Honor me, Yahweh" or "I, Yahweh say."
* By adding the pronoun "I" or "me," the ULB indicates to the reader that God is the speaker.


## Translation Suggestions



* Some translators may decide it is natural and clear in their language to simply follow the literal text and use "Yahweh" with no pronoun added.
* Some may decide to use a pronoun with Yahweh only a few times at the beginning or occasionally in a particular portion of text, but then omit the pronoun in the rest of that section. An ULB example of this is Deuteronomy 5:9-16.
* It is best if possible to keep the name Yahweh where it literally occurs in the text, but some translations may decide to use only a pronoun in some places, to make the text more natural and clear.

* "Yahweh"
