# covenant

## Definition

A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.

* This agreement can be between individuals, between groups of people, or between God and people.
* When people make a covenant with each other, they promise that they will do something, and they must do it.
* Examples of human covenants include marriage covenants, business agreements, and treaties between countries.
* Throughout the Bible, God made several different covenants with his people.
* In some of the covenants, God promised to fulfill his part without conditions. For example when God established his covenant with mankind, promising to never destroy the earth again with a worldwide flood, this promise had no conditions for people to fulfill.
* In other covenants, God promised to fulfill his part only if the people obeyed him and fulfilled their part of the covenant.
