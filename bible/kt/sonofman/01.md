# Son of Man, son of man

## Definition

The title, "Son of Man" is best known for how Jesus used it to refer to himself. In the Old Testament, the term "son of man" was also a way of addressing a man.

* In the Old Testament, the phrase, "son of man" is often used to mean "man" or "human being."
* God used "son of man" as a form of address, as when he said to the prophet Ezekiel, "…you, son of man, must prophesy…" This form of address is used throughout the book of Ezekiel.
* Jesus often used this term to refer to himself instead of saying "I" or "me." It may also have been a modest way of referring to oneself during that time period.
* The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah. Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds.
* Many years after that, the apostle John saw a vision of a "son of man" sitting on the clouds.
* These references to the Son of Man coming, sitting, or riding on the clouds reveal that Jesus is God.
