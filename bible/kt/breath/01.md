## Translation Suggestions



* The phrase "breathed his last" is a figurative way of saying "he died." It could also be translated as, "he took his last breath" or "he stopped breathing and died" or "he breathed in air one last time."
* Describing the Scriptures as "God-breathed" means that God spoke or inspired the words of the Scriptures which human authors then wrote down. It is probably best, if possible, to translate "God-breathed" somewhat literally since it is difficult to communicate the exact meaning of this.
* If a literal translation of "God-breathed" is not acceptable, other ways to translate this could include, "inspired by God" or "authored by God" or "spoken by God." It could also be said that "God breathed out the words of Scripture."
* The expressions "put breath in" or "breathe life into" or "gives breath to" could be translated as, "cause to breathe" or "make alive again" or "enable them to live and breathe" or "give life to."
* If possible, it is best to translate "breath of God" with the literal word that is used for "breath" in the language. If God cannot be said to have "breath," this could be translated as, "God's power" or "God's speech."
* The idiom "catch my breath" or "get my breath" could be translated as, "relax in order to breathe more slowly" or "stop running in order to breathe normally."
* The idiom, "is only a breath," means "lasts a very short time."
* Similarly the phrase, "man is a single breath" means, "people live a very short time" or "the lives of human beings are very short, like a single breath" or "compared to God, the life of a person seems as short as the time it takes to breathe in one breath of air."
