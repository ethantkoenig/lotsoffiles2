# Lord

## Facts

The term "Lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over people. When it is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God.

* In the Old Testament, this term is used in references to God such as "Lord God Almighty" or "Lord Yahweh" or "Yahweh our Lord."
* In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as, "Lord Jesus" and "Lord Jesus Christ," which communicate that Jesus is God.
* In the ULB and UDB, the title, "Lord" is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean "Lord." It is never used as a translation of God's name (Yahweh) as is done in other versions.
