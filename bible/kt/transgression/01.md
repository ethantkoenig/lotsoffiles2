## Translation Suggestions



* "Trangress" could be translated as "sin" or "disobey" or "rebel against."
* If a verse or passage uses two terms that mean "sin" or "transgress" or "trespass," it is important, if possible, to use different ways to translate these terms. Often two or more terms with similar meanings are used in order to emphasize what is being said or to show its importance.
