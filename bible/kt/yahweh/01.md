# Yahweh

## Facts

This is God's personal name that he revealed to Moses at the burning bush. God said that this was his name forever.

* The name "Yahweh" comes from the word meaning "to be."
* This name can mean "he is" or "I am" or "the one who causes to be."
* This name reveals that God is eternal; he has always lived and will continue to live forever. He did not need anyone to create him or to give him life. It also means that he is always present.
* Many Bible versions in major languages such as English, French, and Spanish have used an equivalent of "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh," as in the phrase, "I am the LORD your God" and in many other contexts.
* However, the ULB and UDB only use "Yahweh" to translate God's name, "Yahweh."
* In the New Testament, God is referred to as "Lord" or "God." The term "Yahweh" is not used in the New Testament.


## Translation Suggestions



* This term could be translated by a word or phrase that means "I am" or "living one" or "the one who is" or "he who is alive."
* Note that the ULB text only translates God's name literally, as "Yahweh."
