# New Covenant

## Definition

The term "new covenant" refers to the commitment or agreement God made with his people through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus. 

* The part of the Bible called the "New Testament" refers to this new covenant, which is contrasted to the "old" covenant that God had made with the Israelites during Old Testament times.
* The New Covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus, which completely atoned for people's sins forever. The sacrifices made under the old covenant did not do this.
* God writes the New Covenant on the hearts of believers. As a result of this, Christians want to obey God, and they begin to live holy lives that show that God is working in them.
* The New Covenant will be completely fulfilled when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was at creation. There will be no more sin, suffering, or injustice. Instead, all of God's people will live with him in harmony.
