# church, Church

## Definition

In the New Testament, the term "church" refers to a local group of believers in Jesus who regularly met together to pray and hear God's word preached. The term "the Church" often refers to all Christians.

* This term literally refers to a "called out" assembly or congregation of people who meet together for a special purpose.
* When this term is used to refer to all believers everywhere in the whole body of Christ, some Bible translations capitalize the first letter ("Church") to distinguish it from the local church.
* Often the believers in a particular city would meet together in someone's home. These local churches were given the name of the city such as the "church at Ephesus."
* In the Bible, "church" does not refer to a building.
