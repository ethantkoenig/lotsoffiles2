# high priest

## Definition

The term "high priest" refers to a special priest who was appointed to serve for one year as the leader of all the other Israelite priests.

* The Israelites had many priests, but only one high priest at a time.
* When Jesus was being arrested, Caiaphas was the official high priest. Caiphas' father-in-law Annas is also mentioned sometimes because he was a former high priest who probably still had power and authority over the people.
