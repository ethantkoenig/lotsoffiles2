# Passover

## Facts

The "Passover" is the name of a religious festival that the Jews celebrate every year, to remember how God rescued their ancestors, the Israelites, from slavery in Egypt.

* The name of this festival comes from the fact that God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites and did not kill their sons when he killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians.
* The Passover celebration includes a special meal of a perfect lamb that they have killed and roasted, as well as bread made without yeast. These foods remind them of the meal that the Israelites ate the night before they escaped from Egypt.
* God told the Israelites to eat this meal every year in order to remember and celebrate how God "passed over" their houses and how he set them free from slavery in Egypt.
