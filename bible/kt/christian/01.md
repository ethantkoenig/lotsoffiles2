# Christian

## Definition

Some time after Jesus went back to heaven, people made up the name "Christian" which means, "follower of Christ."

* It was in the city of Antioch where Jesus' followers were first called "Christians."
* A Christian is a person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and who trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
* In our modern times, often the term "Christian" is used for someone who identifies with the Christian religion, but who is not really following Jesus. This is not the meaning of "Christian" in the Bible.
* Because the term "Christian" in the Bible always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus, a Christian is also called a "believer."
