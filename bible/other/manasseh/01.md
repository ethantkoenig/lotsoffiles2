## Facts

There were five men by the name of Manasseh in the Old Testament: 

* Manasseh was the name of Joseph's firstborn son.
* Both Manasseh and his younger brother Ephraim were adopted by Joseph's father, Jacob which gave their descendants the privilege of being among the twelve tribes of Israel.
* The descendants of Manasseh formed one of the tribes of Israel.
* The tribe of Manasseh was often called the "half-tribe of Manasseh" because only part of the tribe settled in the land of Canaan, on the west side of the Jordan River. The other part of the tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan.
