# James (son of Zebedee) #

## Facts: ##

James, a son of Zebedee, was one of Jesus' twelve apostles. He had a younger brother named John who was also one of Jesus' apostles.

* James and his brother John worked by fishing with their father Zebedee.
* James and John were nicknamed the "Sons of Thunder," perhaps because they got angry quickly.
* Peter, James, and John were Jesus' closest disciples and were with him for amazing events such as when Jesus was on a mountaintop with Elijah and Moses and when Jesus caused a dead little girl to come back to life.
* This is a different James than the one who wrote a book in the Bible. Some languages may have to write their names differently to make it clear that they were two different men.
