## Definition

Gold is a yellow-colored precious metal that is very valuable. It was the most valuable metal of the ancient world.

* Gold is a high-quality metal that is found in a pure state in nature and is long-lasting.
  *In Bible times, objects that were made out of gold include idols, jewelry, altars, parts of the ark of the covenant, and other objects used in the tabernacle or temple.  *Sometimes when something is described as "gold" it means that it has a gold overlay, but is not solid gold. In those cases a word like "golden" or "gold-overlaid" could be used.

* Gold was used as a means of exchange in buying and selling. It was weighed on a scale to determine its value.
* After the time of the second temple, gold was used to make coins.
