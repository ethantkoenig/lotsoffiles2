## Definition

Wheat is a type of grass, or grain, that people grow for food.

* The seeds grow at the top of the wheat plant.
* After harvesting the wheat, the seed is separated from the stalk of the plant. This is called "threshing."
* The stalk of the wheat plant, or straw, is often placed on the ground for animals to sleep on.
* The small hulls that surround the seed are called "chaff." They are worthless and are thrown away.
* People grind the seed into flour, and use this for making bread.
