# Sea of Reeds, Red Sea #

## Facts: ##

The "Sea of Reeds" was the name of a body of water located between Egypt and Arabia. It is now called the "Red Sea."
 
* The Red Sea is long and narrow. It is larger than a lake or river, but much smaller than an ocean.
* The Israelites had to cross the Red Sea when they were fleeing from Egypt. God performed a miracle and caused the waters of the sea to divide so that the people could walk across on dry land.
* The land of Canaan was north of this sea.
* This could also be translated as "Reed Sea."
