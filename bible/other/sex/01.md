# have sex with, have relations with, sleep with, lovemaking

## Definition

In the Bible, these terms are euphemisms that refer to having sexual intercourse. (See: [[en/ta-vol2/translate/man/figs_euphemism]])

* In Genesis, the original language text says that Adam "knew" Eve and she conceived children. This expression ("know" or "knew") is usually used for a husband with his wife, so the ULB has translated it as "have marital relations with."
* Some English versions translate this with other euphemistic expressions such as, "make love to" or "be intimate with."
* Different expressions are used in the ULB to refer to sexual relations outside of marriage, such as: "lie with" or "sleep with" or "have sex with" or "have relations with."
* In the Old Testament book, "Song of Solomon," the ULB uses the term "lovemaking" to translate the word "love," which in that context refers to sexual relations. This is related to the expression, "make love to."
