# Ezra #

## Facts: ##

Ezra was an Israelite priest and expert in Jewish law who recorded the history of the Israelites' return to Jerusalem from Babylon where Israel had been held captive for 70 years.

* Ezra recorded this part of Israel's history in the biblical book of Ezra. He may also have written the book of Nehemiah, since these two books had originally been one single book.
* When Ezra returned to Jerusalem he re-established the Law, since the Israelites had stopped obeying the Sabbath laws and had intermarried with women who practiced pagan religions.
* Ezra also helped rebuild the temple which had been destroyed by the Babylonians when they captured Jerusalem.
* There are two other men named Ezra mentioned in the Old Testament.
