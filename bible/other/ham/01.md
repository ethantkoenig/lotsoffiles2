# Ham

## Facts

Ham was the second of Noah's three sons who are mentioned in the Old Testament.

* During the worldwide flood that covered the whole earth, Ham and his brothers were with Noah in the ark, along with their wives.
* After the flood, there was an occasion where Ham was very disrespectful to his father, Noah. As a result, Noah cursed Ham's son Canaan and all his descendants, who eventually became known as the Canaanites.
