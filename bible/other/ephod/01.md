# ephod #

## Definition: ##

An ephod was an apron-like garment worn by the Israelite priests. It had two parts, front and back, that were joined together at the shoulders and tied around the waist with a cloth belt.

* One kind of ephod was made of plain linen and was worn by the ordinary priests.
* The ephod worn by the high priest was specially embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and red yarn.
* The breastpiece of the high priest was attached to the front of the ephod. Behind the breastpiece were stored the Urim and Thummim, which were stones used for asking God what his will was in certain matters.
* The judge Gideon foolishly made an ephod out of gold and it became something that the Israelites worshiped as an idol.
