# Jeremiah #

## Facts: ##

Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah. The Old Testament book of Jeremiah contains his prophecies.

* Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people of Israel that God was going to punish them for their sins.
* Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a deep, dry well and left him there to die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
* Jeremiah wrote that he wished his eyes could be a "fountain of tears," to express his deep sadness over the rebellion and sufferings of his people.
