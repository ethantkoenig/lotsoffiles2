# chief priests #

## Definition: ##

The chief priests were important Jewish religious leaders during the time that Jesus lived on earth.

* They were higher in rank and power than the ordinary priests. Only the high priest had more authority.
* The chief priests were some of Jesus' main enemies and they strongly influenced the Roman leaders to arrest and kill him.
