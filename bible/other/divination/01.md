## Definition

The term "divination" refers to the practice of trying to get information from spirits in the supernatural world. A person who does this is sometimes called a "diviner."

* Divination is sometimes called "soothsaying" or "fortune telling."
* Types of divination include such practices as interpreting patterns in animal bones or in remnants of a drink left behind in a cup.
* In his laws for the people of Israel, God told them to not practice divination.
* God did permit his people to seek information from him using the Urim and Thummim, which were stones that he had designated to be used by the high priest for that purpose.
* Make sure the translation of this word is different than the word for magician or sorcerer.
