# creature #

## Definition: ##

The term "creature" refers to all the living beings that God created, both humans and animals.

* The prophet Ezekiel described seeing "living creatures" in his vision of the glory of God. He did not know what they were, so he gave them this very general label.
* Note that the term "creation" has a different meaning since it includes everything God created, both living and nonliving things (such as land, water, and stars). The term "creature" only includes living things.

## Translation Suggestions #

* Depending on the context, "creature" could be translated as, "being" or "living being" or "created being."
* The plural, "creatures" could be translated as "all living things" or "people and animals" or "animals" or "human beings."
