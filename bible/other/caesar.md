# Caesar #

## Facts: ##

The term "Caesar" was the name or title used by many of the rulers of the Roman Empire. In the Bible, this name refers to three different Roman rulers.

 * The first Roman ruler named Caesar was "Caesar Augustus," who was ruling during the time that Jesus was born.
 * About thirty years later, at the time when John the Baptist was preaching, Tiberius Caesar was the ruler of the Roman Empire. 
 * Tiberius Caesar was still ruling Rome when Jesus told the people to pay Caesar what was due him and to give to God what is due him.
 * When Paul appealed to Caesar, this referred to the Roman emperor, Nero, who also had the title "Caesar."
 * When "Caesar" is used by itself as a title, it can also be translated as: "the Emperor" or "the Roman Ruler."
 * In names such as Caesar Augustus or Tiberius Caesar, "Caesar" can be spelled close to the way a national language spells it.
