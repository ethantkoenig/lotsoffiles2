# Joseph (OT)

## Facts

Joseph was the eleventh son of Jacob and the first son of his mother Rachel.

* Joseph was his father's favorite son so his brothers were jealous of him; they sold him into slavery.

* God brought him to the second highest place of power in Egypt and used him to save Egypt, and his father's family, from starving.
