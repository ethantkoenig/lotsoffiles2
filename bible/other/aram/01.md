# Aram, Aramean, Aramaic #

## Definition: ##

"Aram" was the name of two men in the Old Testament. It was also the name of a region northeast of Canaan, where modern-day Syria is located.

* The people living in Aram became known as "Arameans" and spoke "Aramaic." Jesus and other Jews of his time also spoke Aramaic.
* One of Shem's sons was named Aram. Another man named Aram was a cousin of Rebekah. It is probable that the region of Aram was named after one of these two men.
* Aram later became known by the Greek name "Syria."
* The term "Paddan Aram" means "plain of Aram" and this plain was located in the northern part of Aram.
* Some of Abraham's relatives lived in the city of Haran, which was located in "Paddan Aram."
* In the Old Testament, sometimes the terms "Aram" and "Paddan Aram" refer to the same region.
* The term "Aram Naharaim" may mean "Aram of Two Rivers." This region was located in the northern part of Mesopotamia and was to the east of "Paddan Aram."
