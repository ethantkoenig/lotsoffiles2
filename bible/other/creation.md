# create, creation, Creator #

## Definition: ##

The term "create" means to make something or to cause something to be. Whatever is created is called a "creation." God is called the "Creator" because he caused everything in the entire universe to come into existence.

* When this term is used to refer to God creating the world, it means he made it out of nothing.
* When human beings "create" something, it means they made it out of things that already existed.
* Sometimes "create" is used in a figurative way to describe something abstract, such as creating peace, or creating a pure heart in someone.
* The term "creation" can refer to the very beginning of the world when God first created everything. It can also be used to refer generally to everything that God created. Sometimes the word "creation" refers more specifically to just the people in the world.
