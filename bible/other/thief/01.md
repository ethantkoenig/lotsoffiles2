## Facts

A "thief" is a person who habitually steals money or property that belong to other people. The plural form is "thieves."

* Thieves often use an element of surprise, lurking and watching for opportune moments to take things. Often they use the cover of darkness to hide what they are doing.
* In a figurative sense, the New Testament describes Satan as a thief who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. This means that Satan's plan is to try to keep people from experiencing the blessings that God wants them to have. Satan wants to destroy God's people and keep them from serving God and blessing others.
* Another word for "thief" is "robber" which means, "a person who robs or steals from other people."
* Jesus compares the manner of his return to the suddenness and surprise which characterizes a thief's actions. However, Jesus is not at all like a thief -- his point is that his followers should always be ready for him to come back, since he will return at a time when they are not expecting it.
