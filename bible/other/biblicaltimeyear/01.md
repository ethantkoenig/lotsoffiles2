# biblical time: year

## Definition

In the Bible, the term "year" usually refers to a period of time that lasts about 354 days, according to the 29-day month of a lunar calendar system.

* In the modern-day solar calendar, however, a year lasts 365 days, based on the amount of time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun.
* To adjust for the difference between the length of a year in the two calendar systems, an extra month is added to certain years in the lunar calendar.
* The term "year" is also used in a figurative sense to refer to a general time when a special event takes place. Examples of this include, "the year of Yahweh" or "in the year of drought" or "the favorable year of the Lord." In these contexts, "year" could be translated as "time" or "season" or "time period."
