# watchtower, tower #

## Definition: ##

The term "watchtower" refers to a tall structure built as a place from which guards could look out for any danger. These towers were often made of stone.

* Landowners sometimes built watchtowers from which they could guard their crops and protect them from being stolen.
* The towers often included rooms where the watchmen or family lived, so that they could guard the crops day and night.
* Watchtowers for cities were built higher than the city walls so that watchmen could see if any enemies were coming to attack the city.
* The term "watchtower" is also used as a symbol of protection from enemies. (See: [Metaphor](en/ta-vol1/translate/man/figs-metaphor))
