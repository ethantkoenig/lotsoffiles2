* In the Old Testament book, Song of Songs, "sister" refers to a lover or a spouse.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological sister, unless this would give wrong meaning.
* Other ways to translate this could include, "sister in Christ" or "spiritual sister" or "woman who believes in Jesus" or "fellow woman believer."
* If possible, it is best to use a family term.
* If the language has a feminine form for "believer," this may be a possible way to translate this term.
* When referring to a lover or wife, this could be translated using a feminine form of "loved one" or "dear one."
