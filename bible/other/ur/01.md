# Ur #

## Facts: ##

Ur was an important city along the Euphrates River in the ancient region of Chaldea, which was part of Mesopotamia. This region was located in what is now the modern-day country of Iraq.

* Abraham was from the city of Ur and it was from there that God called him to leave to go to the land of Canaan.
* Haran, the brother of Abraham and father of Lot, died in Ur. This was probably a factor that influenced Lot to leave Ur with Abraham.
