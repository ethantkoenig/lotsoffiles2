## Facts

In the Bible, the "Great Sea" or "western sea" refers to what is now called the "Mediterranean" Sea, which was the largest body of water known to the people of Bible times.

* The Great (Mediterranean) Sea is bordered by : Israel (east), Europe (north and west), and Africa (south).
* This sea was very important in ancient times for trade and travel since it bordered so many countries. Cities and people groups located on the coast of this sea were very prosperous because of how easy it was to access goods from other countries by boat.
* Since the Great Sea was located to the west of Israel, it was sometimes referred to as the "western sea."
