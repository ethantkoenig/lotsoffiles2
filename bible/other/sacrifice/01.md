# sacrifice, offering

## Definition

The term "offering" is a general term that can refer to anything that is given to God, or to an idol. A sacrifice is similar, but normally refers to animals which were killed and then presented to God or to idols.

* In the Bible, offerings and sacrifices were given to God as a form of worship.
* God required the Israelites to make several different kinds of sacrifices and offerings. These included offerings to ask God to forgive sin, and offerings to thank him for blessings. Some of these offerings were the "burnt offering," the "sin offering," the "grain offering," and the "drink offering."
* The names of the offerings depended on what was being offered and for what purpose.
* Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can completely cleanse people from sin. Animal sacrifices could never do that.
