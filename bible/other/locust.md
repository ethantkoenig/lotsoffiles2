* Locusts and other grasshoppers are large, straight-winged insects with long, jointed back legs that give them the ability to jump a long way.
* In the Old Testament, swarming locusts are referred to figuratively as a symbol or picture of the overwhelming devastation that would come as a result of Israel's disobedience.
