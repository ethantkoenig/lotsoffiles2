# lute, lyre #

## Definition: ##

A lute and a lyre are small, stringed, musical instruments that were used by the Israelites to worship God.

* A lyre looks like a small harp, having strings strung across an open frame.
* A lute is very similar to a modernday acoustic guitar, having a wooden sound box and an extended neck on which strings are strung.
* In playing a lute or a lyre, certain strings are held down with the fingers of one hand while these and  other strings are plucked or strummed with the other hand.
* The lute, lyre, and harp are all played by strumming or plucking the strings.
* The number of strings varied, but the Old Testament specifically mentions instruments that had ten strings.
