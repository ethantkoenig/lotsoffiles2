# descendant, descended from #

## Definition: ##

A "descendant" is someone who is a direct blood relative of someone else further back in history.

* For example, Abraham was a descendant of Noah.
* A person's descendants are his children, grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren, and so on. Jacob's descendants were the twelve tribes of Israel.
* The phrase "descended from" is another way of saying "a descendant of" as in, "Abraham was descended from Noah." This could also be translated as, "from the family line of."
