Goshen was the name of a fertile region of land located along the Nile River in the northern part of Egypt.

 * When Joseph was a ruler in Egypt, his father and brothers and their families came to live in Goshen to escape a famine in Canaan.
 * They and their descendants lived well in Goshen for over 400 years, but then they were forced into slavery by the Egyptian pharaoh.
 * Finally God sent Moses to help the people of Israel leave the land of Goshen and escape this slavery.
