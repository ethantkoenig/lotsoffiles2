# biblical volume

## Definition

The following terms were the most common biblical units of volume used to explain how much a certain container could hold. The containers and measurements are given for both liquids (such as wine) and dry solids (such as grain). ^  Type ^  Measurement ^  Value ^  Units ||  Dry |  omer |  2.00 |  liters ||  Dry |  ephah |  22.00 |  liters ||  Dry |  homer |  220.00 |  liters ||  Dry |  kor |  220.00 |  liters ||  Dry |  seah |  7.70 |  liters ||  Liquid |  metrete |  40.00 |  liters ||  Liquid |  bath |  22.00 |  liters ||  Liquid |  hin |  3.70 |  liters ||  Liquid |  kab |  1.23 |  liters ||  Liquid |  log |  0.31 |  liters |How to translate units of volume in the Bible:  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent amount using a unit of measure that is known.  - These methods could be combined, using the Bible term, but then also giving the equivalent amount in the text or a note.<b>measure</b> \\ Sometimes the Hebrew does not specify a particular unit of volume but only uses a number. In these cases, many English versions, and the ULB and UDB, add the word "measure." For example in Haggai 2:16 it has, "twenty (measures) of grain" and "fifty (measures) of wine."Translation suggestions when the unit of measure is implied:  - Translate literally, using the number without giving a unit.\\  - Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "portion." \\   - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain and "jar" for wine. \\   - Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.
