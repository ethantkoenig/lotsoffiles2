## Facts

The terms "mourn" and "mourning" refer to expressing deep grief, usually in response to the death of someone. In many cultures, mourning includes specific outward behaviors that show this sadness and grief.

* The Israelites and other people groups in ancient times expressed mourning through loud wailing and lamenting, much as many present-day societies do.
* Professional mourners were hired to loudly weep and wail, often from the time of death until well after the body is put in the tomb. These mourners were usually women.
* The typical period of mourning was seven days, but could last as long as thirty days (as for Moses and Aaron) or seventy days (as for Jacob).
* The Bible also uses the term figuratively, to talk about "mourning" because of sin. This refers to feeling deeply grieved because of how our sin hurts God, ourselves, and other people.
