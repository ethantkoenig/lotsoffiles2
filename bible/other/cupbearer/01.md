In Old Testament times, a "cupbearer" was a king's servant who was given the task of bringing the king his cup of wine, usually tasting the wine first to make sure it had not been poisoned.

* The literal meaning of this term is "cup bringer" or "someone who brings the cup."
* A cupbearer was known for being very trustworthy and loyal to his king.
* Because of his trusted position, a cupbearer would often have influence in the decisions the ruler made.
