# servant, slave, slavery

## Definition

A servant is a person who works for another person, either by choice or by force. The word for "slave" can also mean "servant." The surrounding text usually makes it clear which word fits better in that context.

* In Bible times, servants or slaves were an important part of their master's household and many were treated almost like members of the family. In the Old Testament, a person could choose to become a lifetime servant to his master.
* A slave is a kind of servant who is the property of the person he works for. The person who buys a slave is called his "owner" or "master." Some masters treat their slaves very cruelly, while other masters treat their slaves very well.
* In ancient times, some people willingly became slaves to a person they owed money to in order to pay off their debt to that person. 
* Sometimes in the Bible the phrase "I am your servant" is used as a sign of respect and service.
* In the Old Testament, God's prophets and other people who worshiped God are often referred to as his "servants."
* In the New Testament, people who obey God through faith in Christ are often called his "servants." Christians are also called "slaves to righteousness" which is a metaphor that compares the commitment to obey God to a slave's commitment to obeying his master.
