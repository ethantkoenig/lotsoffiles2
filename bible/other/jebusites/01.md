# Jebusite

## Facts

The Jebusites were a tribe in the land of Canaan, who were descended from a man named Jebus.

* Jebus conquered the ancient city of Jerusalem and named it after himself, so it was called "Jebus" for awhile. Later the name was changed back again.
* Melchizedek, the priest-king in both the Old and New Testaments, was of Jebusite origin.
