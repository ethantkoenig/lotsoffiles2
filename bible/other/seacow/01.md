# sea cow #

## Definition: ##

The term "sea cow" refers to a large sea animal that eats sea grass and other vegetation on the ocean floor. 

* A sea cow is grey with thick skin. It moves in the water using its flippers.
* The skins or hides of the sea cow were used by people in Bible times for making tents. These animal hides were used in the coverings for the tabernacle.
* It was nicknamed the "sea cow" because it eats grass like a cow does, but they are not similar in other ways.
* Related animals are the "dugong" and the "manatee."
