# command, to command, commandment #

## Definition: ##

The term "to command" means to order someone to do something. A "command" or "commandment" is what the person was ordered to do.

* Although these terms have basically the same meaning, "commandment" often refers to certain commands of God which are more formal and permanent, such as the "Ten Commandments."
* A command can be positive ("Honor your parents") or negative ("Do not steal").
* To "take command" means to "take control" or "take charge" of something or someone.

## Translation Suggestions ##

* It is best to translate this term differently from the term, "law." Also compare with the definitions of "decree" and "statute."
* Some translators may prefer to translate "command" and "commandment" with the same word in their language.
* Others may prefer to use a special word for commandment that refers to lasting, formal commands that God has made.
