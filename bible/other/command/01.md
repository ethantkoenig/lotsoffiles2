## Translation Suggestions



* It is best to translate this term differently from the term, "law." Also compare with the definitions of "decree" and "statute."
* Some translators may prefer to translate "command" and "commandment" with the same word in their language.
* Others may prefer to use a special word for commandment that refers to lasting, formal commands that God has made.
