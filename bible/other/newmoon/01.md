The term "new moon" in the Bible refers to the moon when it looks like a small, crescent-shaped sliver of light. This is the beginning phase of the moon as it moves in its orbit around the planet Earth.

* In ancient times, the new moon was used to mark the beginnings of certain time periods, such as months.
* The Israelites celebrated a new moon festival that was marked by the blowing of a ram's horn.
* The Bible also refers to this period of time as the "beginning of the month."
