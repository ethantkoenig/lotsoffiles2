# hail #

## Facts: ##

This term usually refers to small or large lumps of frozen water that fall from the sky. A different word, "hail" is used in greeting someone and can mean, "hello" or "greetings to you."

* Hail that comes down from the sky is in the form of balls or chunks of ice called "hailstones."
* Usually hailstones are small (only a few centimeters wide), but sometimes there are hailstones that are as big as 20 centimeters wide and that weigh over a kilogram.
* The book of Revelation in the New Testament describes enormous hailstones weighing 50 kilograms that God will cause to fall on earth when he judges people for their wickedness in the end times.
* The word "hail" that is a formal greeting in older English literally means "rejoice" and could be translated as "Greetings!" or "Hello!"
