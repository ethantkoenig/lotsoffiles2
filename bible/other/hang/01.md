# hang #

## Definition: ##

The term "hang" means to suspend something or someone above the ground.

* Death by hanging typically is done by tying a rope that is tied around a person's neck and sustending him from an elevated object, like a tree limb. Judas killed himself by hanging.
* Although Jesus died while hanging on a wooden cross, there was nothing around his neck: the soldiers suspended him by nailing his hands (or wrists) and his feet to the cross.
* To hang someone always refers to the way of killing someone by hanging them with a rope around their neck.
