# mediator #

## Definition: ##

A mediator is a person who helps two or more people to resolve their disagreements or conflicts with each other. He helps them to become reconciled.

* Because people have sinned, they are God's enemies who deserve his wrath and punishment. Because of sin, the relationship between God and his people is broken.
* Jesus is the mediator between God the Father and his people, restoring that broken relationship through his death as payment for their sin.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Ways to translate "mediator" could be "go-between person" or "reconciler" or "person who brings peace."
* Compare this term with how the term "priest" is translated. It is best if the term "mediator" is translated differently.
