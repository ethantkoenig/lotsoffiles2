## Facts: ##

In the book of Genesis, Seth was the third son of Adam and Eve.

* Eve said that Seth was given to her in place of her son Abel, who was murdered by his brother Cain.
* Noah was one of Seth's descendants, so everyone who has lived since the time of the Flood is also a descendant of Seth.
* Seth and his family were the first people to "call on the name of the Lord."
