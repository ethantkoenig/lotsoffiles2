# Jonah #

## Definition: ##

Jonah was a Hebrew prophet in the Old Testament.

* The book of Jonah tells the story of when God sent Jonah to preach to the people of Nineveh.
* Jonah refused to go to Nineveh and instead got on a ship headed for a different city.
* God caused a huge storm to overwhelm that ship.
* When the men sailing the ship found out that Jonah was disobeying God, they threw him into the sea and the storm stopped.
* Jonah was swallowed by a huge fish, and he was inside the belly of that fish for three days and nights.
* After that, Jonah went to Nineveh and preached to the people there, and they turned from their sins.
