## Definition: ##

A "burnt offering" was a type of sacrifice to God that was burnt up by fire on an altar. It was offered to make atonement for the sins of the people. This was also called an "offering by fire."

* Animals used for this offering were usually sheep or goats, but oxen and birds were also used.
* Except for the skin, the entire animal was burned up in this offering. The skin or hide was given to the priest.
* God commanded the Jewish people to offer burnt offerings two times every day.
