# staff #

## Definition: ##

A staff is a long wooden stick or rod, often used as a walking stick.

* When Jacob was old, he used a staff to help him walk.
* God turned Moses' staff into a snake to show his power to Pharaoh.
* Shepherds also used a staff to help guide their sheep, or to rescue the sheep when they fell or wandered.
* The shepherd's staff had a hook on the end, which was different from the shepherd's rod, which was straight and was used to kill wild animals trying to attack the sheep.
