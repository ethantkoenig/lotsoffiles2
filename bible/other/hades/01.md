## Definition

Hades is the place where the souls of people go when they die. They remain in hades until they are raised to stand before God in the final judgment.

* The Hebrew name that is used in the Old Testament is sheol. The Greek name that is used in the New Testament is hades. They refer to the same place.
* Hades appears to be divided into two parts. There is a place of suffering for unbelievers, and a place of comfort for believers. 
* Hades is temporary. Believers in hades will eventually go to heaven. Unbelievers in hades will eventually be thrown into hell.
