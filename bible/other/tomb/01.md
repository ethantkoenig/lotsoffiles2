# tomb, grave, burial place

## Definition

A tomb is a place where people put the bodies of those who die.

* The Jews sometimes used natural caves as tombs, and sometimes they dug caves out of the rock on the side of a hill.
* In New Testament times, it was common to roll a large, heavy, round stone in front of the opening of a tomb in order to close it.
* This term can also be translated as, "grave." But if your word for grave can only refer to a hole in which the body is placed below the ground, then it might be better to translate tomb as, "cave" or "hole in a hill."
