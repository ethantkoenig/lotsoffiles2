# Asaph

## Facts

Asaph was a Levite priest and gifted musician who wrote the music for the psalms of King David. He also wrote his own psalms.

* Asaph was appointed by King David to be one of three musicians who were responsible for the "service of song" in the temple.
* Some of these songs were also prophecies.
* Asaph trained his sons and they and other descendants carried on this responsibility, playing instruments and prophesying in the temple.
* Psalms 50 and 73-83 are said to be from Asaph. It may be that some of these psalms were also written by his family members.
