## Facts

When a person has a vision, it means he has seen something that is not from our physical world. In the Bible, a vision is something unusual that God shows someone supernaturally.

* Usually, visions are seen while the person is awake. However sometimes a vision is something a person sees in a dream while asleep.
* God sends visions to tell people something that is very important. For example, Peter was shown a vision to tell him that God wanted him to welcome Gentiles.
