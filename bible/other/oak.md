# oak #

## Definition: ##

An oak, or oak tree,  is a tall shade tree with a large trunk and wide spreading branches.

* Oak trees have strong, hard wood that was used to build ships and to make farming plows, oxen yokes and walking sticks.
* The seed of an oak tree is called an acorn.
* The trunks of certain oak trees could be as wide around as 6 meters.
* Oak trees were symbolic of long life and had other spiritual meanings. In the Bible, they were often associated with holy places.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Many translations will have to say "oak tree" rather than just "oak."
* If oak trees are not known in the receptor area, this could be translated as "an oak, which is a large shade tree likeâ€¦," then give the name of a local tree that has similar characteristics.
