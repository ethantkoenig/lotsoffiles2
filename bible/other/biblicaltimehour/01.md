# biblical time: hour

## Definition

The term <b>hour</b>  is often used in the Bible to tell more specifically what time a certain event took place.

* The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 a.m.). For example, “the ninth hour” meant “around three in the afternoon.”
* Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 p.m.). For example, “the third hour of the night” meant “around nine in the evening” in our present-day system..
* Since references to time in the Bible will not correspond exactly to the present-day time system, phrases such as “around nine” or “about six o'clock” could be used.    
* Some translations might add phrases like "in the evening" or "in the morning" or "in the afternoon" to make it clear what time of day is being talked about.
