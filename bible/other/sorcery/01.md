## Definition

"Sorcery" or "witchcraft" refers to using magic, which involves doing powerful things through the help of evil spirits. A "sorcerer" is someone who does these powerful, magical things.

* Sorcery can involve doing good things such as healing someone, or harmful things such as putting a curse on someone. But all kinds of sorcery are wrong because they involve using an evil spirit's power.
* The use of sorcery is a great evil in God's sight. It is considered as evil as other terrible sins, such as adultery, worshiping idols, and child sacrifice.
* This could also be translated as, "evil spirit power" or "black magic" or "casting spells."
* The term "sorcerer" could be translated with a word or phrase that means, "worker of magic" or "person who casts spells" or "person who does miracles using evil spirit power."
