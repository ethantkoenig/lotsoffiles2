* The tribe of Simeon occupied the southernmost territory in the promised land of Canaan, an area that was part of Judah's inheritance.
* In the New Testament, a godly man named Simeon was in the temple at Jerusalem when Joseph and Mary brought the baby Jesus there to dedicate him to God. Simeon blessed Jesus and praised God for providing the Messiah who would be the Savior for all people.
