# well, cistern

## Definition

The terms "well" and "cistern" refer to two different kinds of sources for water in Bible times.

* A well was a deep hole dug into the ground so that underground water can flow into it.
* A cistern was also a dug-out deep hole used as a holding tank for collecting rain water.
* Cisterns were usually dug into rock and sealed with plaster to keep the water in. A "broken cistern" happened when the plaster became cracked so that the water leaked out.
* Cisterns could be 6 meters deep and 1 meter wide at the top opening.
* Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.
* Both wells and cisterns were usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it. Often there was a rope with a bucket attached to it to bring the water up to the surface.
* Sometimes a dry cistern was used as a place to imprison someone, such as happened to Joseph and Jeremiah.


## Translation Suggestions



* Ways to translate "well" could include, "deep water hole" or "deep hole for spring water" or "deep hole for drawing water."
* The term "cistern" could be translated as "stone pit" or "deep and narrow pit for water" or "underground tank for holding water."
* These terms are similar in meaning. The main difference is that a well usually receives water from underground springs whereas the water in a cistern usually comes from rain.
