## Facts: ##

The Jordan River is a river that flows from north to south, and forms the eastern boundary of the land that was called Canaan.

* Today, the Jordan River separates Israel on its west from Jordan on its east. 
* The Jordan River flows through the Sea of Galilee and then empties into the Dead Sea.
* When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, they had to cross the Jordan River. It was too deep, but God miraculously stopped the river from flowing so they could go across.
* Often in the Bible the Jordan River is referred to as "the Jordan."
