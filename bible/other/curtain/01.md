In the Bible, curtains were thick, heavy pieces of material used in the construction of the tabernacle during Israel's desert wanderings.

* Thick, heavy curtains made of materials such as animal skins and cloth  formed the top and sides of the tabernacle building.
* There was a curtain that separated the holy place from the most holy place in the tabernacle and then later in the temple.

* In some English Bible versions, this curtain of the inner sanctuary is also called a veil, which has the meaning of concealing or hiding from view..
