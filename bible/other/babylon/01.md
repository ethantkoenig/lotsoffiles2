# Babylon, Babylonian

## Facts

The ancient city of Babylon was the capital of the Babylonian Empire. It was located in the ancient region of Babylonia, which is now the country of Iraq.

* Babylon was located along the Euphrates River, in the same region where the Tower of Babel had been built hundreds of years before.
* Sometimes the word "Babylon" refers to the entire Babylonian Empire. For example, the "king of Babylon" ruled the entire empire, not just the city.
* The Babylonians were a powerful people group who attacked the kingdom of Judah and kept them in exile in Babylonia for 70 years.
* Part of this region was called "Chaldea" and the people living there were the "Chaldeans." So often the term "Chaldea" in the Bible is referring to Babylonia.
* In the New Testament, the term "Babylon" is used metaphorically and prophetically to represent places, people, and thinking patterns that are sinful, in rebellion against God, and full of idol-worship.
* In the book of Revelation, the phrase "Babylon the Great" or "great city of Babylon" is used several times, indicating that the city being referred to metaphorically was a large, wealthy and politically important city.
