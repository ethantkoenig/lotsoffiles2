# shadow #

## Definition: ##

The word "shadow" literally refers to the darkness that is caused by an object blocking the light. It also has several figurative meanings.

* The "shadow of death" means that death is present or near, just as a shadow indicates the presence of its object.
* Many times in the Bible, the life of a human being is compared to a shadow, which does not last very long and has no substance.
* Sometimes "shadow" is used as another word for "darkness."
* The Bible talks about being hidden or protected in the shadow of God's wings or hands. This is a picture of being protected and hidden from danger. Other ways to translate "shadow" in these contexts could include "shade" or "safety" or "protection."
* It is best to translate "shadow" literally using the local term that is used to refer to an actual shadow.
