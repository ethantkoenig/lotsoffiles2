# new moon #

## Definition: ##

The term "new moon" refers to the moon when it looks like a small, crescent-shaped sliver of light. This is the beginning phase of the moon as it moves in its orbit around the planet Earth at sunset. It also refers to the first day a new moon should be visible after the moon has been dark for a few days.

* In ancient times, new moons marked the beginnings of certain time periods, such as months.
* The Israelites celebrated a new moon festival that was marked by the blowing of a ram's horn.
* The Bible also refers to this time as the "beginning of the month."
