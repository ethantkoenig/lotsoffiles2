# ox, oxen #

## Definition: ##

An "ox" is a type of cattle that is specifically trained to do agricultural work. The plural of this term is "oxen." Usually oxen are male and have been castrated.

* Throughout the Bible, oxen were depicted as animals tied together by a yoke to pull a cart or a plow.
* Having oxen work together under a yoke was such a common occurrence in the Bible that the phrase "to be under a yoke" became a metaphor for hard work and labor.
*  A bull is also a male type of cattle, but it has not been castrated and has not been trained as a work animal.
