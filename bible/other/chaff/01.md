# chaff

## Definition

Chaff is a dry protective covering of a grain seed. The chaff is not good for food so people separate it from the seed and throw it away.

* People separate the chaff from the seed is by throwing the grain seed and chaff up into the air. The wind blows the chaff away and the seed falls onto the ground.
* In the Bible, evil people and evil, worthless things are compared to chaff.
