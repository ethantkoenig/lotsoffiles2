# flood

## Definition

The term "flood" literally refers to a large amount of water that completely covers over the land. It is also used figuratively to refer to an overwhelming amount of something, especially happening in a sudden way.

* In Noah's time, people had become so evil that God caused a worldwide flood to come over the entire surface of the earth, even covering the mountaintops. All other floods cover a much smaller land area.
* This term can also be an action as in, "I flood my bed with tears."
