## Facts: ##

In New Testament times, Berea (or Beroea) was a prosperous Greek city in southeast Macedonia, about 80 kilometers south of Thessalonica.

* Paul and Silas fled to the city of Berea after their fellow Christians helped them escape from certain Jews who had caused trouble for them in Thessalonica.
* When the people living in Berea heard Paul preach, they researched the Scriptures to confirm that what he was telling them was true.
