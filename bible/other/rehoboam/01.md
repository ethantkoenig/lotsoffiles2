# Rehoboam

## Facts

Rehoboam was one of the sons of King Solomon, and became the king of the nation of Israel after Solomon died.

* When Rehoboam spoke too severely to the people of Israel, ten of the tribes rebelled against him. Because of this, the nation of Israel became two kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south.
* Rehoboam continued to be the king of the kingdom of Judah, which consisted of the two tribes who remained loyal to him.
* Rehoboam was a wicked king who did not obey Yahweh, but served false gods.
