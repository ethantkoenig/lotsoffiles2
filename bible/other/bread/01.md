# bread

## Definition

Bread is a food made from flour mixed with water and oil. It is usually made with something that makes it rise, such as yeast. It is then shaped into a loaf and baked.

* Bread can also be made without yeast so that it does not rise. This is called "unleavened bread" and was used for the Jews' passover meal.
* Since bread was the main food for many people in biblical times, this term was sometimes used in the Bible to refer to food in general, as in the phrase, "daily bread."
