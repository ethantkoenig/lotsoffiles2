# Boaz

## Facts

Boaz was the husband of Ruth, the great grandfather of King David, and an ancestor of Jesus Christ.

* Boaz lived during the time when there were judges in Israel (between the 14th and 11th century B.C.)
* Boaz "redeemed" Ruth, who was the widow of one of his distant relatives. This is a picture of the redemption that Jesus performed.
