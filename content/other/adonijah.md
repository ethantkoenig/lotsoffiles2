## Definition: ##

Adonijah was the fourth son of King David.

* Adonijah tried to take over as king of Israel after the deaths of his brothers Absalom and Amnon.
* God, however, had promised that David's son Solomon would be king., so Adonijah's plot was overthrown and Solomon was made king.
* When Adonijah tried a second time to make himself king, Solomon put him to death.
