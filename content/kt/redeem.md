# redeem, redemption, redeemer #

## Definition: ##

The terms "redeem" and "redemption" refer to buying back something that was previously owned or held captive. A "redeemer" is someone who redeems something or someone.

* God gave laws to the Israelites about how to redeem people or things.
* For example, someone could redeem a person who was in slavery by paying the price so that the slave could go free. The word "ransom" also refers to this practice.
* If someone's land had been sold, a relative of that person could "redeem" or "buy back" that land so that it would stay in the family.
* These practices show how God redeems people who are in slavery to sin. When he died on the cross, Jesus paid the full payment for people's sins and redeemed all those who trust in him for salvation. People who have been redeemed by God are set free from sin and its punishment.
