# Savior #

## Facts: ##

The term "Savior" refers to a person who saves or rescues others from danger. It can also refer to someone who gives strength to others or provides for them.

* In the Old Testament, God is referred to as Israel's Savior because he often rescued them from their enemies, gave them strength, and provided them with what they needed to live.
* In the New Testament, "Savior" is used as a description or title for Jesus Christ because he saves people from being eternally punished for their sin. He also saves them from being controlled by their sin.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Ways to translate this term could include, "the One who saves" or "God, who saves" or "who delivers from danger" or "who rescues from enemies" or "Jesus, the one who rescues (people) from sin."
