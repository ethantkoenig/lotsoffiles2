# circumcise, circumcision #

## Definition: ##

The term "circumcise" means to cut off the foreskin of a man or male child. A circumcision ceremony may be performed in connection with this.

* God commanded Abraham to circumcise every male among his family and servants as a sign of God's covenant with them.
* God also commanded Abraham's descendants to continue to do this for every baby boy born into their households.
* The phrase, "circumcision of the heart" refers figuratively to the "cutting away" or removal of sin from a person.
* In a spiritual sense, "the circumcised" refers to people whom God has purified from sin through the blood of Jesus and who are his people.
* The term "uncircumcised" refers to those who have not been circumcised physically. It can also refer figuratively to those who have not been circumcised spiritually, who do not have a relationship with God.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* If the culture of the target language performs circumcisions on males, the word used to refer to this should be used for this term.
* Other ways to translate this term would be, "cut around" or "cut in a circle" or "cut off the foreskin."
* In cultures where circumcision is not known, it may be necessary to explain it in a footnote or glossary.
* Make sure the term used to translate this does not refer to females. It may be necessary to translate this with a word or phrase that includes the meaning of "male."
