# Sabbath #

## Definition: ##

The term "Sabbath" refers to the seventh day of the week, which God commanded the Israelites to set apart as a day of rest and doing no work.

* After God finished creating the world in six days, he rested on the seventh day. In the same way, God commanded the Israelites to set aside the seventh day as a special day to rest and worship him.
* The command to "keep the Sabbath holy" is one of the ten commandments that God wrote on the stone tablets that he gave Moses for the Israelites.
* Following the Jewish system of counting days, the Sabbath begins on Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown.
* Sometimes in the Bible the Sabbath is called "Sabbath day" rather than only the Sabbath. 

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* This could also be translated as "resting day" or "day for resting" or "day of not working" or "God's day of rest."
* Some translations capitalize this term to show that it is a special day, as in "Sabbath Day" or "Resting Day."
* Consider how this term is translated in a local or national language.
