# cross #

## Definition: ##

In Bible times, a cross was an upright wooden post stuck into the ground, with a horizontal wooden beam attached to it near the top.

* During the time of the Roman Empire, the Roman government would execute criminals by tying or nailing them to a cross and leaving them there to die.
* Jesus was falsely accused of crimes he did not commit and the Romans put him to death on a cross.
* Note that this is a completely different word from the verb "cross" that means to go over to the other side of something, such as a river or lake.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* This term could be translated using a term in the target language that refers to the shape of a cross.
* Consider describing the cross as something on which people were killed, using phrases such as "execution post" or "tree of death."
* Also consider how this word is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See: [How to Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md))
