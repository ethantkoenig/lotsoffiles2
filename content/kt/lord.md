# lord, master, sir #

## Definition: ##

The term "lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people.

* This word is sometimes translated as "master" when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.
* Some English versions translate this as "sir" in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* This term should be translated as "master" when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It could also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.
* When it refers to Jesus, it could be translated as "master" if the context shows it means "religious teacher."
* If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, "lord" could be translated as "sir." This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.
* When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is written as "Lord" (capitalized).
