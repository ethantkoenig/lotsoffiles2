* It can also refer to the punishment or other negative things that someone causes to happen to someone.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* This term could be translated as "cause bad things to happen to" or "declare that something bad will happen to" or "swear to cause evil things to happen to."
* In the context of God sending curses on his disobedient people, it could be translated as, "punish by allowing bad things to happen."
* The term "cursed" when used to describe people could be translated as, "(this person) will experience much trouble."
* The phrase "cursed be" could be translated as, "May (this person) experience great difficulties."
* The phrase, "Cursed is the ground" could be translated as, "The soil will not be very fertile."
* "Cursed be the day I was born" could also be translated as, "I am so miserable it would have been better not to be born."
* However, if the target language has the phrase "cursed be" and it has the same meaning, then it is good to keep the same phrase.
