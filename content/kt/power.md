* God has complete power over everything that he has created.
* God gives his people power to do what he wants, so that when they heal people or do other miracles, they do this by the power of God.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Depending on the context, the term "power" could also be translated as "ability" or "strength" or "energy" or "ability to do miracles" or "control."
* Possible ways to translate the term "powers" could include, "powerful beings" or "controlling spirits" or "those who control others."
