# God the Father, heavenly Father, Father #

## Facts: ##

The terms "God the Father" and "heavenly Father" refer to Yahweh, the one true God. This term also occurs as "Father," especially when Jesus was referring to him.

* God exists as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Each one is fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that mere humans cannot fully understand.
* God the Father sent God the Son (Jesus) into the world and he sends the Holy Spirit to his people.
* Anyone who believes in God the Son becomes a child of God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit comes to live in that person. This is another mystery that human beings cannot fully understand.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* In translating the phrase "God the Father," it is best to translate "Father" with the same word that the language naturally uses to refer to a human father.
* The term "heavenly Father" could be translated by "Father who lives in heaven" or "Father God who lives in heaven" or "God our Father from heaven."
* Usually "Father" is capitalized when it, refers to God.
