# teacher, Teacher #

## Definition: ##

A teacher is a person who gives other people new information. Teachers help others to obtain and use both knowledge and skills.

* In the Bible, the word "teacher" is used in a special sense to refer to someone who teaches about God. It does not refer to a school teacher.
* People who learn from a teacher are called "students" or "disciples."
* In some Bible translations, this term is capitalized ("Teacher") when it is used as a title for Jesus.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* The usual word for a teacher can be used to translate this term, unless that word is only used for a school teacher.
* Some cultures may have a special title that is used for religious teachers, such as "Sir" or "Rabbi" or "Preacher."
